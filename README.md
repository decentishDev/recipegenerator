# Random Recipe Generator

This is a simple web application that generates random recipes when a button is clicked. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project, including the code and this README file, was created by ChatGPT.

## Features

- Generates a random recipe from a predefined list
- Displays the recipe title, ingredients, and instructions
- Simple and clean user interface

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click the "Generate Recipe" button to display a random recipe.

## Customizing the Recipes

To add more recipes to the application, simply edit the `script.js` file and add more recipe objects to the `recipes` array. Each recipe object should have the following structure:

```javascript
{
    title: "Recipe Title",
    ingredients: ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", ...],
    instructions: "Step-by-step instructions for preparing the recipe."
}
